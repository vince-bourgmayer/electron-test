# electron-test

## What it is
`electron-test` is an **exploratory personal project** developed during my time at university.  
It’s a functional desktop application built with **Electron, Node.js, HTML/CSS**, used personally to explore app development and packaging for desktop environments.

---

## Why it exists
The goal of this project was to:

- Experiment with **Electron for desktop app development**  
- Understand **Node.js integration** and front-end/back-end interaction in a desktop context  
- Build a **working prototype** to test ideas quickly

> Note: This project was mainly for personal learning and experimentation. It’s not maintained as a production-level application.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vince-bourgmayer/electron-test.git
   ```
   
2.  install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Technical notes
- Built with **Electron 12.x**  
- Basic app structure:  
  - `main.js` → main process  
  - `renderer.js` → renderer process / UI logic  
  - `index.html`, `style.css` → front-end  
- Minimal architecture, **designed for experimentation**, not production

---

## What I learned
- How to **package a desktop application** using Electron  
- How to manage **main vs renderer processes**  
- Integrating **Node.js APIs** in a desktop app  
- Basic project organization for small Electron apps

---

## Current state
- Functional prototype, fully usable locally  
- Not maintained; no testing or CI setup  
- Code structure is basic and reflects **early learning phase**

---

## Status & Scope
> This repository is **a demonstration of an exploratory project**.  
> It showcases a personal experiment in desktop app development rather than a production-ready application.
