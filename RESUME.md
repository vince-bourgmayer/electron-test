# Resume of projet's progress
## 28/09/17
It's not easy to find time those days...
1. Looking on the web for some subject around electron.js.
	- It should be possible to use some C++ lib thanks to Node.JS but it will need some adaptation as it's wrote [here](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html).
	- To get and send Data between 'view' and 'controller' I have to use IPC object. I found good example [here](https://github.com/crilleengvall/electron-tutorial-app)
	- Just checked difference between `var`, `let`and `const`in EcmaScript 6 ([ressource](http://putaindecode.io/fr/articles/js/es2015/const-let-var/). I remembered V.Jousse lesson with Scala :)

1. Updating mainframe html
	* Removing lorem ipsum and Hello world
	* Inspired by this [tuto](https://tutorialzine.com/2015/12/creating-your-first-desktop-app-with-html-js-and-electron)
	* Adding Jquery. I will try to add a caroussel via [slick](https://plugins.jquery.com/slick/)

2. Creation of UI directory which will contain user interfaces files

3. Get an old version of jquery from old project, to check if it works and it seems to work!

4. Sleep!

5. Test without internet connexion to verify. It works!

6. Installation of slick-carousel via npm: `npm install slick-carousel`. It also install Jquery.

7. Continued to play with UI, Jquery, slick. Looking for add CSS (bootstrap).
I ran `npm install bootstrap@3`. I'm still looking for how send event from view to main.js.
I feel that I will look up near React.js or something else.

8. Found [tuto](https://tutorialzine.com/2015/12/creating-your-first-desktop-app-with-html-js-and-electron) which is a little old but give a way.
I discover Flipster But in the end slick-carousel is better. I played with css.

Project creation and first action

1. I firstly created github project, then clone it into local.
I used a node .gitignore generated by Github and I choose the unlicence which I don't know.

2. I created `RESUME.md` and `BACKLOG.md`

3. I created archive project-management and added first mainframe proposition.
I used Balsamiq to create the UI proposition. I also played with markdown.

4. I installed Electron:
 * Launch a terminal and go to project directory
 * use `npm install electron --save-dev --save-exact`

5. Creation of app entry point: `main.js` and hello world IHM in `index.html`

6. Running app with: `.\node_modules\.bin\electron .`

7. I tried to run basic app with different option to see what would happen. I discovered what is a JumpList.
