# Resume of projet's progress
## 25/09/17

1. Updating mainframe html
	* Removing lorem ipsum and Hello world
	* Inspired by this [tuto](https://tutorialzine.com/2015/12/creating-your-first-desktop-app-with-html-js-and-electron)
	* Adding Jquery. I will try to add a caroussel via [slick](https://plugins.jquery.com/slick/)

2. Creation of UI directory which will contain user interfaces files

3. Get an old version of jquery from old project, to check if it works and it seems to work!

4. Sleep!

5. Test without internet connexion to verify. It works!

6. Installation of slick-carousel via npm: `npm install slick-carousel`. It also install Jquery.

7. Continued to play with UI, Jquery, slick. Looking for add CSS (bootstrap).
I ran `npm install bootstrap@3`. I'm still looking for how send event from view to main.js.
I feel that I will look up near React.js or something else.

8. Found [tuto](https://tutorialzine.com/2015/12/creating-your-first-desktop-app-with-html-js-and-electron) which is a little old but give a way.
I discover Flipster But in the end slick-carousel is better. I played with css.

I used a node .gitignore generated by Github and I choose the unlicence which I don't know.
