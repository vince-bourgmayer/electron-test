# Resume of projet's progress

## 24/09/17  
Project creation and first action
1. I firstly created github project, then clone it into local.
I used a node .gitignore generated by Github and I choose the unlicence which I don't know.

2. I created `RESUME.md` and `BACKLOG.md`

3. I created archive project-management and added first mainframe proposition.
I used Balsamiq to create the UI proposition. I also played with markdown.

4. I installed Electron:
 * Launch a terminal and go to project directory
 * use `npm install electron --save-dev --save-exact`

5. Creation of app entry point: `main.js` and hello world IHM in `index.html`

6. Running app with: `.\node_modules\.bin\electron .`
