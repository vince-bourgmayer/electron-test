# Steps
_I can't give many many time on this project so talking about sprint or iteration would be an error.
To be effective and don't spread my time again and again I will pick up users stories 2 by 2.
I will change users stories(US) when first are over. This part is a kind of delivery's plan._

 1. ~~Users stories : 10 and 11~~
 2. ~~Users stories : 12 and 1~~
 3. Users stories : 2 and 3
 4. Users stories : 5 and 6
 5. Users stories : 4 and 7
 6. Users stories : 8 and 9
