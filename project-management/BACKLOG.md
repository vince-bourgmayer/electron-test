# Steps
_I can't give many many time on this project so talking about sprint or iteration would be an error.
To be effective and don't spread my time again and again I will pick up users stories 2 by 2.
I will change users stories(US) when first are over. This part is a kind of delivery's plan._

 1. ~~Users stories : 10 and 11~~
 2. ~~Users stories : 12 and 1~~
 3. ~~Users stories : 2 and 3~~
 4. ~~Users stories : 5 and 6~~
 5. ~~Users stories : 4 and 7~~
 6. ~~Users stories : 8 and 9~~
 7. ~~Users stories : 13 and 14~~
